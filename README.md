The 2024 Lok Sabha Elections have made history by lasting 44 days and are declared the largest-ever election since the 1952 India general elections. PM Narendra Modi who completed his second term as Prime Minister is running for a third consecutive term. BJP has won twice with a huge majority in the last two Lok Sabha Elections. INC, which was a formative force, has witnessed a constant decline since 2014. The Congress Party led by President Mallikarjun Kharge has formed a multi-party political alliance, the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (I.N.D.I.A), that includes several political parties from India. Leaders from 28 parties have come together to join this alliance and stand as an opposition front to the NDA.

The overall election result was described in several media sources as a "shock" to Narendra Modi, with the BJP falling short of its expectations of winning 400 seats. Though pre-poll predictions were for an overwhelming majority for the BJP, the INDIA bloc performed much better than exit polls had predicted it to, with upset victories in major states such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and West Bengal. The BJP had to rely on the 28 cumulative seats won by the Andhra Pradesh-based Telugu Desam Party led by Chandrababu Naidu and the Bihar-based Janata Dal (United) led by Nitish Kumar in order for the NDA to retain its majority in the Lok Sabha.
